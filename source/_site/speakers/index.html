<p><strong>Talk title: Wicked Bizarre Semiconductor Physics of Sensor Security</strong></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Medical devices, healthcare delivery, and other cyber-physical 
systems depend on sensors to make safety-critical, automated decisions. 
My research lab investigates the problem of how to protect cyber-physical 
systems from adversaries who can maliciously control sensor output by 
subverting its semiconductor physics. Finding principled, systematic 
solutions is extremely important to give consumers confidence in innovative 
medical devices and other emerging technology. Unique to our embedded 
security research contributions is an emphasis on protecting the longevity 
of implanted batteries and using software-only approaches to mitigate design 
flaws in legacy hardware. These contributions were important to creating the 
field of medical device security; advancing the academic community’s ability 
to measurably defend against signal injection attacks on sensors; and changing 
how international regulators evaluate security of consumer products. In this talk, 
I will highlight academic research on protecting sensor semiconductors from 
maliciously modulated sound waves, radio waves, and lasers that can compromise 
software systems in cyber-physical systems such as pacemakers and vaccine 
cold-chain transportation. I hope to inspire students to work on these fun science 
and engineering problems.</p>

Engineering and the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern 
University, where he directs the Archimedes Center for Health Care and 
Medical Device Cybersecurity. Fu previously served as the nation’s 
inaugural Acting Director of Medical Device Cybersecurity at U.S. 
FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and 
Program Director for Cybersecurity at the Digital Health Center of 
Excellence (DHCoE). His research vision is a world where science-based 
security is built-in by design to all embedded systems: medical devices, 
healthcare delivery, autonomous transportation, manufacturing, and the 
Internet of Things. His research lab focuses on analog cybersecurity—how 
to model and defend against threats to the physics of computation and 
sensing. Fu is most known for his security research on cryptographic 
and low-power inventions to defend against vulnerabilities in an implantable 
cardiac defibrillator. His research led to a decade of revolutionary 
improvements at medical device manufacturers, global regulators, 
and international healthcare safety standards bodies. Security solutions 
resulting from this research foresaw the risks of malicious software 
affecting hospitals a decade before ransomware began to disrupt clinical 
workflow worldwide.</p>

<p>Fu has been recognized as an IEEE Fellow, ACM Fellow, AAAS Fellow, 
Sloan Research Fellow, and MIT Technology Review TR35 Innovator of the 
Year. He received best paper awards from USENIX Security, IEEE Security &amp; Privacy, 
and ACM SIGCOMM. His research on pacemaker security received an IEEE Security &amp; Privacy 
Test of Time Award. He co-founded healthcare cybersecurity startup Virta Labs. 
Fu has testified in the House and Senate and was commissioned by the National 
Academy of Medicine for a report on trustworthy medical device software. 
He serves as a member of the Association for the Advancement of Medical 
Instrumentation (AAMI) Biomedical Instrumentation &amp; Technology Editorial Board,

Steering Committee. He chairs the USENIX Security Test of Time Awards 
Selection Committee. He chaired the USENIX Security PC and served as the 
inaugural co-chair of the AAMI cybersecurity working group to create the first 
FDA-recognized consensus standards to improve the security of medical device 
manufacturing. He founded the Archimedes Center for Healthcare and Device 
Security, and co-founded the N95decon.org team for emergency reuse 
decontamination of N95 masks during pandemic shortages. Fu served as a 
member of the U.S. NIST Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board 
and federal science advisory groups. Fu received his BS, MEng, and PhD

<p><strong>Talk title: From NAND to SCOTUS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> When can we trust the result of a computation? What 
guarantees do we need to have about the physical system that performed 
the computation? about the algorithms used? about the data used and 
its provenance? What aspects of the computation need further scrutiny 
and what can be taken for granted? What conclusions can be legitimately 
drawn from  the computation and its result and what conclusions would be 
unfounded or even reckless?</p>

<p>Given the increasingly critical role of data and computation in our society, 
such questions are routinely asked  —  and need to be answered  —  by courts, 
policymakers, journalists, and practically everyone. Yet, the computing community (industry and academia alike) 
is surpisingly ill-equipped to provide meaningful answers to these questions. 
The problem is made worse by  the immensely complex and multi-layered 
nature of modern computing systems, by communication barriers across 
disciplines, and finally  by social  misconceptions and legal 
doctrines that make it hard to pursue meaningful answers to trustworthiness 
questions, even when such questions are pertinent and critical. Following an attempt 
to frame the problem and challenge the computing community to address it head on, 
I will describe some attempts at addressing this challenge in specific contexts: 
Bluetooth-based proximity detection, using zero-knowledge proofs to reconcile 
defendant rights to scrutinize evidence with law enforcement priviledge, 
making the Apple CSAM detection protocol publicly verifiable.</p>

at Boston University and the director of the center for Reliable
Information System and Cyber Security. He is a Fellow of the 
Association for Computing Machinery and the International Association

Award in Mathematics. Canetti graduated from the Weizmann Institute of Science,
was a researcher at IBM Watson Research Center, a research scientist
at MIT and a professor at Tel Aviv University. Canetti’s research interests 
lie primarily in  cryptography and information security, with emphasis 
on the design, analysis and use of cryptographic algorithms and 
protocols. Recently he has been studying ways for the co-design 
of algorithms, law, and policy so as to provide sound foundations 
for society in the information age.</p>
