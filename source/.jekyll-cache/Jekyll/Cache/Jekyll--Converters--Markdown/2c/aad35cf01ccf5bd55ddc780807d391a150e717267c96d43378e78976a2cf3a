<p><strong>Talk title: Donâ€™t Trust, and Verify</strong></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk I will address two distinct vectors at the frontier of hardware security:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Given the challenges in defending against unknown attacks, an important vector in
hardware security is obfuscation-based defenses, where randomization and encryption
are used to increase the design entropy that an attacker needs to overcome for direct
access to secrets, or indirect access through first accessing critical system information
assets needed to mount a successful attack.</li>
  <li>Hardware defenses, through obfuscation or microarchitecture structures, are subject to
implementation bugs just as the rest of the design, and thus need to be verified/validated
prior to deployment. Given the higher costs of security design bug escapes, formally
verifying these defenses is gaining increasing importance.</li>
</ol>

<p>I will discuss specific projects along both these vectors driven by practical concerns of low
design overhead and scalability of formal verification techniques.
This is joint work with the groups of Todd Austin (Michigan), Lauren Biernacki (Lafayette
College), Thomas Bourgeat (EPFL) and Mengjia Yan (MIT).</p>

He has served as the Director of the multi-university MARCO Gigascale Systems Research
Center (GSRC, 2009-2012), and as the Associate Director of the Center for Future
Architectures Research (C-FAR, 2013-2016). His current research focuses on design
methodology for formal functional and security verification of hardware/hardware-software
systems. His research in functional timing analysis and propositional satisfiability has been
widely used in industrial electronic design automation tools. He has received the IEEE/ACM
Design Automation Conference (DAC) Award for the most cited paper in the 50-year history of
the conference (2013), the Computer-Aided Verification (CAV) Award for fundamental
contributions to the development of high-performance Boolean satisfiability solvers (2009), the
IEEE CEDA A. Richard Newton Technical Impact Award in Electronic Design Automation
(2017), the Princeton University Presidentâ€™s Award for Distinguished Teaching (2009), as well
as several other research and teaching awards. He has also received the UC Berkeley
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Distinguished Alumni Award (2019) and the IIT
Delhi Distinguished Alumni Award (2009). He is a fellow of the IEEE and ACM.</p>
