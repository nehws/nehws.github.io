margin: 5px" /> <strong>Bio:</strong> Kevin Fu is Professor of Electrical and
Computer Engineering in the College of Engineering and the Khoury
College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, where he
directs the Archimedes Center for Health Care and Medical Device
Cybersecurity. Fu previously served as the nationâ€™s inaugural Acting
Director of Medical Device Cybersecurity at U.S. FDAâ€™s Center for
Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and Program Director for
Cybersecurity at the Digital Health Center of Excellence (DHCoE). His
research vision is a world where science-based security is built-in by
design to all embedded systems: medical devices, healthcare delivery,
autonomous transportation, manufacturing, and the Internet of
Things. His research lab focuses on analog cybersecurityâ€”how to model
and defend against threats to the physics of computation and
sensing. Fu is most known for his security research on cryptographic
and low-power inventions to defend against vulnerabilities in an
implantable cardiac defibrillator. His research led to a decade of
revolutionary improvements at medical device manufacturers, global
regulators, and international healthcare safety standards
bodies. Security solutions resulting from this research foresaw the
risks of malicious software affecting hospitals a decade before
ransomware began to disrupt clinical workflow worldwide.</p>

<p>Fu has been recognized as an ACM Fellow, IEEE Fellow, Sloan Research
Fellow, and MIT Technology Review TR35 Innovator of the Year. He is a
recipient of a Feb100 Award and NSF CAREER Award. He received best
paper awards from USENIX Security, IEEE Security &amp; Privacy, and ACM
SIGCOMM. His research on pacemaker security received an IEEE Security
&amp; Privacy Test of Time Award. He co-founded healthcare cybersecurity
startup Virta Labs. Fu has testified in the House and Senate and was
commissioned by the National Academy of Medicine for a report on
trustworthy medical device software. He serves as a member of the
Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI)
Biomedical Instrumentation &amp; Technology Editorial Board, the ACM
Committee on Computers and Public Policy, and the USENIX Security
Steering Committee. He chairs the USENIX Security Test of Time Awards
Selection Committee. He chaired the USENIX Security PC and served as
the inaugural co-chair of the AAMI cybersecurity working group to
create the first FDA-recognized consensus standards to improve the
security of medical device manufacturing. He founded the Archimedes
Center for Healthcare and Device Security, and co-founded the
N95decon.org team for emergency reuse decontamination of N95 masks
during pandemic shortages. Fu served as a member of the U.S. NIST
Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board and federal science
advisory groups. Fu received his BS, MEng, and PhD from MIT. He earned
a certificate of artisanal bread making from the French Culinary
Institute, builds wood-fired brick ovens, and enjoys woodworking.</p>
