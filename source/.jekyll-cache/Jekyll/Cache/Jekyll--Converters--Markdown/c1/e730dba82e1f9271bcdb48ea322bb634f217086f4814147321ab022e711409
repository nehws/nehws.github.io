margin: 5px" /> <strong>Bio:</strong> G. Edward Suh is a Senior Director of Research, and leads a group in security 
and privacy research. He is also an Adjunct Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer 
Engineering at Cornell University, where he served on the faculty from 2007 to 2023. Before joining 
NVIDIA, he was a Research Scientist in the Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team at Meta. He earned 
a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Seoul National University and an M.S. and a Ph.D. in Electrical 
Engineering and Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His research 
interests include computer systems in general with particular focus on computer architecture and 
security. His recent research focuses on building secure computing systems for secure and private 
AI, and using AI to improve the security of computer systems. His past research received multiple 
test-of-time awards and is widely recognized for the impact at the intersection of hardware and security. 
For example, his work on Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is now used in commercial products such as 
Xilinx FPGAs for storing secret keys. His work on the AEGIS secure processor received a test-of-time 
award for its contribution for trusted execution environments deployed across the industry today. He is a 
Fellow of IEEE.</p>

<p><img src="../images/todd_austin.png" alt="" style="width: 300px; float: left;
margin: 5px" /> <strong>Bio:</strong> Todd Austin is the S. Jack Hu Collegiate Professor of Electrical Engineering and 
Computer Science at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. His research interests include computer 
architecture, robust and secure system design, hardware and software verification, and performance analysis 
tools and techniques. From 2012-2017, Todd was the director of C-FAR, the Center for Future Architectures 
Research, a multi-university SRC/DARPA funded center that was seeking technologies to scale the performance 
and efficiency of future computing systems. Prior to joining academia, Todd was a Senior Computer Architect 
in Intel’s Microcomputer Research Labs, a product-oriented research laboratory in Hillsboro, Oregon. Todd 
is the first to take credit (but the last to accept blame) for creating the SimpleScalar Tool Set, a 
popular collection of computer architecture performance analysis tools. Todd is co-author (with Andrew 
Tanenbaum of Vrije Universiteit) of the undergraduate computer architecture textbook, “Structured Computer 
Architecture, 6th Ed.” In addition to his work in academia, Todd is founder of SimpleScalar LLC, and co-founder 
of Agita Labs Inc. and InTempo Design LLC. In 2002, Todd was a Sloan Research Fellow, and in 2007 he received 
the ACM Maurice Wilkes Award for “innovative contributions in Computer Architecture including the SimpleScalar 
Toolkit and the DIVA and Razor architectures.” Todd is an IEEE Fellow, and he received his PhD in Computer 
Science from the University of Wisconsin in 1996.</p>
