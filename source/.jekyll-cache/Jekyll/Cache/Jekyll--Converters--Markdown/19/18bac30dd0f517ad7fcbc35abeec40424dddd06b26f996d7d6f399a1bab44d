<p><strong>Talk title: Composable chiplets and implications for disaggregated design</strong></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The compounding effect of monolithic miniaturization on electronics has been nothing short of miraculous. In the 1960s, $1 would get you a single slow and bulky transistor. In 2020, that same dollar adjusted for inflation buys you a System-On-Chip (SoC) with over  100 million incredibly fast nanoscale transistors. Now that physical device scaling is approaching hard atomic limits, the question is: Where will the next million fold computing efficiency improvement come from? Highly specialized heterogeneous application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) can offer 1000x improvement in Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWAP-C) compared to general-purpose processors. Unfortunately, circuit specialization is poorly aligned with the modern Moore’s Law silicon machine that prioritizes unit cost over engineering costs at all stages of development and manufacturing. In particular, two major economic roadblocks stand in the way of domain specific hyper specialized circuits:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The design of leading edge monolithic chips costs $100M - $1,000M and takes years to complete,</li>
  <li>Monolithic integration of new devices and materials to advanced CMOS processes costs more than $1B and generally increases per unit production costs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Chiplets offer a compelling solution to both of these roadblocks. In this talk I will give an overview of the chiplet design landscape and present recent efforts by Zero ASIC to create a system of composable 2D and 3D chiplets supported by a full stack of open interface standards.</p>

From 2017 - 2020, Mr. Olofsson was a program manager at DARPA, where he managed 8 different US research programs in heterogeneous integration, EDA, design &amp; verification, high performance computing, machine learning, and analog computing. From 2008-2017, Mr. Olofsson founded and managed Adapteva, an ultra lean fabless semiconductor startup that led the industry in processing energy efficiency. Prior to Adapteva he worked at Analog Devices for 10 years as a design manager and architect for advanced DSPs and mixed signal devices, developing products that shipped in over 100 million systems. Mr. Olofsson received his Bachelor of Science in Physics and Electrical Engineering and Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. He is a senior member of IEEE and holds nine U.S. patents.</p>
