and privacy research. He is also an Adjunct Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer 
Engineering at Cornell University, where he served on the faculty from 2007 to 2023. Before joining 
NVIDIA, he was a Research Scientist in the Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team at Meta. He earned 
a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Seoul National University and an M.S. and a Ph.D. in Electrical 
Engineering and Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His research 
interests include computer systems in general with particular focus on computer architecture and 
security. His recent research focuses on building secure computing systems for secure and private 
AI, and using AI to improve the security of computer systems. His past research received multiple 
test-of-time awards and is widely recognized for the impact at the intersection of hardware and security. 
For example, his work on Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is now used in commercial products such as 
Xilinx FPGAs for storing secret keys. His work on the AEGIS secure processor received a test-of-time 
award for its contribution for trusted execution environments deployed across the industry today. He is a 
Fellow of IEEE.</p>
