<p><strong>Talk title: Chip-Backside Vulnerability to Side Channel Attacks Exploiting Intentional Electromagnetic Interference</strong></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Si substrate backside of an integrated circuit (IC) chip, more precisely, the backside surface of its Silicon substrate provides open areas for adversarial security attacks. An IC chip becomes vulnerable against electromagnetic (EM) interference in both emanation and irradiation particularly in flip-chip packaging. The talk covers EM side channel (SC) leakages over the Si substrate backside, additionally with intentional SC amplification according to design falsification. It also details the mechanisms of bit-flip errors in bistable circuits intentionally caused by high-voltage pulse (HVP) injection on the backside of the IC. The chip-backside vulnerability of an IC chip will be experimentally given with Si examples as well as analytically described with simulation models.</p>

in Intel’s Microcomputer Research Labs, a product-oriented research laboratory in Hillsboro, Oregon. Todd 
is the first to take credit (but the last to accept blame) for creating the SimpleScalar Tool Set, a 
popular collection of computer architecture performance analysis tools. Todd is co-author (with Andrew 
Tanenbaum of Vrije Universiteit) of the undergraduate computer architecture textbook, “Structured Computer 
Architecture, 6th Ed.” In addition to his work in academia, Todd is founder of SimpleScalar LLC, and co-founder 
of Agita Labs Inc. and InTempo Design LLC. In 2002, Todd was a Sloan Research Fellow, and in 2007 he received 
the ACM Maurice Wilkes Award for “innovative contributions in Computer Architecture including the SimpleScalar 
Toolkit and the DIVA and Razor architectures.” Todd is an IEEE Fellow, and he received his PhD in Computer 
Science from the University of Wisconsin in 1996.</p>

He received his MS and PhD from the University of California, Berkeley in 1986 and 1988, respectively. He joined MIT in 1988 and served as Associate Head of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, with responsibility for Computer Science, from 2005 to 2011.
Devadas’s research interests span Computer-Aided Design (CAD), computer security and computer architecture and he has received significant awards from each discipline. He received the 1990 IEEE Transactions on CAD best paper award for work on synthesis for testability and the 1996 IEEE Transactions on VLSI Systems best paper award for work on power estimation. He received the 50th Design Automation Conference (DAC 2013) Top 10 Cited Author Award, for being among the top ten most cited DAC authors in DAC’s 50 year history and the DAC Best-Paper Hat-Trick Award, for winning DAC best paper awards three times. Devadas was elected a Fellow of the IEEE in 1999 for contributions to design automation.
Devadas and his students invented silicon Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) in 2002. PUFs are the technological basis of the founding of Verayo, a company focused on improving the security of computer hardware. Based on integrated-circuit manufacturing variation, Verayo has developed secure RFID chips that are in use in anti-counterfeiting applications and secret-key generation technology. Devadas’s papers on PUFs have received best paper awards at ACSAC 2002, HOST 2011 and HOST 2012.
In computer architecture, Devadas’s papers on analytical cache modeling and the Aegis single-chip secure processor were recognized as influential papers in the “25 Years of the International Conference on Supercomputing” volume. His work on hardware-information flow tracking published in the 2004 ASPLOS received the ASPLOS Most Influential Paper Award in 2014.</p>
