**Talk title: Chip-Backside Vulnerability to Side Channel Attacks Exploiting Intentional Electromagnetic Interference**

**Abstract:** Si substrate backside of an integrated circuit (IC) chip, more precisely, the backside surface of its Silicon substrate provides open areas for adversarial security attacks. An IC chip becomes vulnerable against electromagnetic (EM) interference in both emanation and irradiation particularly in flip-chip packaging. The talk covers EM side channel (SC) leakages over the Si substrate backside, additionally with intentional SC amplification according to design falsification. It also details the mechanisms of bit-flip errors in bistable circuits intentionally caused by high-voltage pulse (HVP) injection on the backside of the IC. The chip-backside vulnerability of an IC chip will be experimentally given with Si examples as well as analytically described with simulation models.

[//]: <> **Talk title: Don’t Trust, and Verify**

[//]: <> **Abstract:** In this talk I will address two distinct vectors at the frontier of hardware security:
[//]: <> 1. Given the challenges in defending against unknown attacks, an important vector in
[//]: <> hardware security is obfuscation-based defenses, where randomization and encryption
[//]: <> are used to increase the design entropy that an attacker needs to overcome for direct
[//]: <> access to secrets, or indirect access through first accessing critical system information
[//]: <> assets needed to mount a successful attack.
[//]: <> 2. Hardware defenses, through obfuscation or microarchitecture structures, are subject to
[//]: <> implementation bugs just as the rest of the design, and thus need to be verified/validated
[//]: <> prior to deployment. Given the higher costs of security design bug escapes, formally
[//]: <> verifying these defenses is gaining increasing importance.

[//]: <> I will discuss specific projects along both these vectors driven by practical concerns of low
[//]: <> design overhead and scalability of formal verification techniques.
[//]: <> This is joint work with the groups of Todd Austin (Michigan), Lauren Biernacki (Lafayette
[//]: <> College), Thomas Bourgeat (EPFL) and Mengjia Yan (MIT).
