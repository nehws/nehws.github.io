### **Kevin Fu** ###
**Northeastern University**

**Talk title: Wicked Bizarre Semiconductor Physics of Sensor Security**

![](../images/kevin-fu.jpg){: style="width: 200px; float: left;
margin: 5px"} **Bio:** Kevin Fu is Professor of Electrical and
Computer Engineering in the College of Engineering and the Khoury
College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, where he
directs the Archimedes Center for Health Care and Medical Device
Cybersecurity. Fu previously served as the nation's inaugural Acting
Director of Medical Device Cybersecurity at U.S. FDA’s Center for
Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and Program Director for
Cybersecurity at the Digital Health Center of Excellence (DHCoE). His
research vision is a world where science-based security is built-in by
design to all embedded systems: medical devices, healthcare delivery,
autonomous transportation, manufacturing, and the Internet of
Things. His research lab focuses on analog cybersecurity—how to model
and defend against threats to the physics of computation and
sensing. Fu is most known for his security research on cryptographic
and low-power inventions to defend against vulnerabilities in an
implantable cardiac defibrillator. His research led to a decade of
revolutionary improvements at medical device manufacturers, global
regulators, and international healthcare safety standards
bodies. Security solutions resulting from this research foresaw the
risks of malicious software affecting hospitals a decade before
ransomware began to disrupt clinical workflow worldwide.

Fu has been recognized as an ACM Fellow, IEEE Fellow, Sloan Research
Fellow, and MIT Technology Review TR35 Innovator of the Year. He is a
recipient of a Feb100 Award and NSF CAREER Award. He received best
paper awards from USENIX Security, IEEE Security & Privacy, and ACM
SIGCOMM. His research on pacemaker security received an IEEE Security
& Privacy Test of Time Award. He co-founded healthcare cybersecurity
startup Virta Labs. Fu has testified in the House and Senate and was
commissioned by the National Academy of Medicine for a report on
trustworthy medical device software. He serves as a member of the
Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI)
Biomedical Instrumentation & Technology Editorial Board, the ACM
Committee on Computers and Public Policy, and the USENIX Security
Steering Committee. He chairs the USENIX Security Test of Time Awards
Selection Committee. He chaired the USENIX Security PC and served as
the inaugural co-chair of the AAMI cybersecurity working group to
create the first FDA-recognized consensus standards to improve the
security of medical device manufacturing. He founded the Archimedes
Center for Healthcare and Device Security, and co-founded the
N95decon.org team for emergency reuse decontamination of N95 masks
during pandemic shortages. Fu served as a member of the U.S. NIST
Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board and federal science
advisory groups. Fu received his BS, MEng, and PhD from MIT. He earned
a certificate of artisanal bread making from the French Culinary
Institute, builds wood-fired brick ovens, and enjoys woodworking.

**Talk title: From NAND to SCOTUS**

**Abstract:** When can we trust the result of a computation? What 
guarantees do we need to have about the physical system that performed 
the computation? about the algorithms used? about the data used and 
its provenance? What aspects of the computation need further scrutiny 
and what can be taken for granted? What conclusions can be legitimately 
drawn from  the computation and its result and what conclusions would be 
unfounded or even reckless?

Given the increasingly critical role of data and computation in our society, 
such questions are routinely asked  ---  and need to be answered  ---  by courts, 
policymakers, journalists, and practically everyone. Yet, the computing community (industry and academia alike) 
is surpisingly ill-equipped to provide meaningful answers to these questions. 
The problem is made worse by  the immensely complex and multi-layered 
nature of modern computing systems, by communication barriers across 
disciplines, and finally  by social  misconceptions and legal 
doctrines that make it hard to pursue meaningful answers to trustworthiness 
questions, even when such questions are pertinent and critical. Following an attempt 
to frame the problem and challenge the computing community to address it head on, 
I will describe some attempts at addressing this challenge in specific contexts: 
Bluetooth-based proximity detection, using zero-knowledge proofs to reconcile 
defendant rights to scrutinize evidence with law enforcement priviledge, 
making the Apple CSAM detection protocol publicly verifiable.

at Boston University and the director of the center for Reliable
Information System and Cyber Security. He is a Fellow of the 
Association for Computing Machinery and the International Association 
for Cryptologic Research, and an incumbent of the RSA 
Award in Mathematics. Canetti graduated from the Weizmann Institute of Science,
was a researcher at IBM Watson Research Center, a research scientist
at MIT and a professor at Tel Aviv University. Canetti’s research interests 
lie primarily in  cryptography and information security, with emphasis 
on the design, analysis and use of cryptographic algorithms and 
protocols. Recently he has been studying ways for the co-design 
of algorithms, law, and policy so as to provide sound foundations 
for society in the information age.
